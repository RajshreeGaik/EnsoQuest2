                              <strong>It all began with a simple need and a shared vision</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We are Anuja and Rajshree,  good friends and college mates who were fortunate to be placed in the same company. During our training, we realized the need for a unified platform to streamline the test-taking process. This platform would allow users to take tests, track their results and performance, access resources, receive important notices and notifications, and provide valuable feedback.             </p>
                          <p>
                            Inspired and encouraged by our trainer, Mr. Burhan Malik, we decided to turn this idea into reality, and that's how this test application came to life.
                          </p>
